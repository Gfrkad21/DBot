### Code Format

d.createCommand(trigger = trigger, reply = reply1, reply2 = reply2, emoji = emoji, image = link, help = help)

d.bRun(TOKEN)
```

### Code Format (Shorter)

```Python
from discord_bot_maker import DBot

d = DBot(bPrefix : tuple = ".", owner : str = FATHER, helpCommand : bool = True, baseCode : bool = True)

d + (trigger = trigger, reply = reply1, reply2 = reply2, emoji = emoji, image = link, help = help)

d(TOKEN)
```
